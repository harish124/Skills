It states:  
* Simplest solution is always the right one

This folder shows one of my brilliant experiments I did  
to identify the number of youths who watch por*  

You guys clicked it because you were able to decode it! Some would have clicked it out of curiosity  

# Anyway, by clicking it, you're IP didn't get tapped.  
* You guys won't be monitored by me for the next 30 days by me!

# To the youths who understood this experiment!
* Your brain is like a fresh sponge.  
* You can dip it in eithern clean water or dirty water, that's your choice  
But remember your actions in the real world will be based on your subconcious mind,   
# so make sure  
You dip your spongy brain in good things!
