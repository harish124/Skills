# Ofcourse you wouldn't have found Megha Akash

Before revealing the solution:  
Where did you search for MA in that pic?  
You searched her amidst the black dots?

The pic represents your life and the black dots represents problems in your life.  
When your focus was on black dots, naturally you lost focus on white bkg, I had written Megha Akash in white text.  

# Similarly in life
When you focus too much on problems , you will loose focus on your life.

# How to find Megha Akash then?
Stop focussing on problems and start focussing on life, your life will become beautiful like the clouds and sky (clouds-megha sky-akash)

# So that's why I love Megha Akash
* In fact who doesn't ðŸ˜‰
